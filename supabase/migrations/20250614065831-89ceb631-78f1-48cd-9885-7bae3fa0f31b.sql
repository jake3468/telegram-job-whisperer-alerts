-- First, let's drop the existing RLS policies that are causing the issue
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own LinkedIn posts" ON public.job_linkedin;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own LinkedIn posts" ON public.job_linkedin;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own LinkedIn posts" ON public.job_linkedin;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own LinkedIn posts" ON public.job_linkedin;

-- Create completely permissive policies for job_linkedin table
-- We'll handle security in the application layer since we're using Clerk auth
CREATE POLICY "Allow all select operations on LinkedIn posts"
